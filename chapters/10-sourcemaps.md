# Sourcemaps

Sourcemaps are a crucial tool when developing a project. Because we are working with development tools like Babel, Sass and others it's important to know the source of any problems that could arise.

Often the outputted bundle is not much help as it's the compiled source, we need to track down all errors to our source files.

Webpack offers sourcemaps right out of the box without adding any existing plugins.
